 Hey guys, so I'm going to show you how I'm going to blend this paper and also boil it on this mind blender.
 So I'm going to bring you something. I know it's not easy for you to bring out one and twenty thousand and I have to buy this or some cold blender.
 But it's a very good purchase. You've been buying different blenders. It's skillful. It's meant to bring out smoke because you are buying forty thousand and fifty thousand and I have blender.
 Why not just, you know, sum it up. You can't pay on instalment to get a blender. This blender is a beauty.
 This is a pastel blender you are going to use to dash it out. It is forever. It can blend anything.
 You can see, you can blend heist, grinding, sauce, fruits and veggies.
 You can help you cook your soy milk, your rice, your cream sauce, anything.
 This blender is a video.
 So let me show you just the chain, let me show you things to use this blender.
 See, I support the fact that if you want to buy something, it is better if you just close.
 I buy original thing that you don't have to repair every K-market dish.
 You don't have to change every K-market dish.
 You guys, you don't have to change every time.
 Just close.
 I buy it once.
 I know it is not easy as a single girl to go and buy blender once in 2000.
 That is why there is opportunity for you to, you know, buy on instalments.
 You know, for this money that you're using for 20,000, 25,000 and 30,000,
 before you close that open it, you saw me talking, so I want 20,000 already.
 This painter is very cool, let me show you how to use, see?
