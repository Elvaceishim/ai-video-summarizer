 Hey guys, so I want to quickly show you how I'm going to blend this bepe and also boil it on this mine blender.
 It sounds very something I know it's not easy for you to bring it out to one and since it's a thousand and to back, this or some cool blender, but it's in very good process.
 You've been buying different blenders, it's skillful, it's been to bring it out smooth because you're buying for six thousand and a fifty thousand and a blender.
 One of those, you know, so middle, you can't be on instalming to get it blended, this blender is a beauty.
 It's a Basquaben that you're going to use to dust it out, it's forever.
 It's compliant with the highest. You can see it's compliant with the highest grinding,
 sauce, fruit and veggies. You can help you cook your soy milk, your rice, your cream sauce,
 anything. This blender is a video. So let me show you just a change. Let me show you how
 you can use this blender. See, I suppose the fact that if you want to buy something,
 it's about to just close a bible, which is nothing that you don't have to prepare every
 k-maketis. You don't have to change every k-maketis. You don't have to change every time. Just close
 a bite once. Anyway, it's not easy at the same time. You have to go and buy a blender once in
 That's why there is opportunity for you to, you know, burn and install mates.
 You know what this money that you're using, 20,000 hours in 5,000 hours, 30,000 hours before your clothes are open,
 your so-me-top, your so-me-top in 7,000 hours already.
 This painting is very cool, let me show you how to use it.
 See, I've been using this mine since December, so we are going to put it at grinding, so...
 Let me show you.
 I've been using this my own way for a very long time.
 So now I'm waiting to steam it. I want to steam it. I want to call it the stew. That's the steam I'm boiling. So I'm going to do it like this.
 I'm going to steam. So I'm going to show you after the thing.
 Guys, look at this. It is boiled. Done.
 You see this jar? It's so heavy. You know what that means?
 Hey, what's your boy?
 Shatam?
 Taka-taka?
 For me, that's right, don't do me.
 Taka-taka, I don't use my paper.
 Mm-hmm.
 So I'm going to put it inside my paper.
